## About Math Rush 

## Vision

Here we outline our future vision for Math Rush.

### Professor-Student Model <a name="professor-student-model"></a>

One goal for the future is to partner with the Mathematics Department at the University of Hawaii. Professors would be able to create "courses" that would align with their course schedules. A student can sign up for a course, which gives them access to the games specific to that subject. The games-type page would update automatically for new topics according to the course schedule. Students would still have access to games about previous topics, but the showcased games would reflect the topics they are currently learning in class. The professors would create the games using templates that we provide. 

### Real-Time Multiplayer Games <a name="real-time-multiplayer-games"></a>

Not every game should be a one-person experience. We want to create games that can be played simultaneously with any number of students. This would allow an entire class of students to participate in the same game at once. This would encourage friendly competition while studying new material. These games would have a built in group chat that allows students to ask for help, and interact with their classmates.
 
A professor could set suggested times for students to log in and play in order to maximize participation. Students could opt-in to receive an email 5-10 minutes before the suggested game time. Or when a student logs in, they will recieve a notification of an ongoing or upcoming suggested game time. 

To take it even further a professor could have a moderator role, creating questions in real-time for the students to solve. A seperate professor message feed could be displayed so that his/her messages don't get lost in the regular group chat.

### Leaderboards

The leaderboards will contain statistics from the different types of games played. From discrete mathematics to calculus 4, the leaderboard will keep track of all the different topics and rank each player based on their performances. 

## Milestone 1 <a name="milestone-1"></a>

Milestone 1 started on November 8th, 2017, and ended on November ___, 2017.

The goals for this milestone were to complete the mockup HTML for the Landing, Home, User-Profile, Leaderboard, and Game Types pages. Then, to link these pages together using Meteor FlowRouter. 

To start, we downloaded [Bowfolios](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios) and added our mockups to the pages folder. We then converted each mockup page to a template which could be used by FlowRouter. Here are some of the mockup pages:

#### Landing Page

#### Profile Page
